<h2><a name="REMARKS" id="REMARKS"></a>REMARKS.</h2>


<p>This comedy excites that sensation, which is the best security for the
success of a drama&mdash;curiosity. After the two first acts are over, and
pleasantly over, with the excellent drawn characters of Ashfield and his
wife, and the very just satire which arises from Sir Abel's propensity
to modern improvements&mdash;the acts that follow excite deep interest and
ardent expectation; both of which are so highly gratified at the
conclusion of the play, that, from the first night of its performance,
it has ranked among the best of the author's productions, and in the
first class of modern comedies.</p>

<p>The various characters of this play are admirably designed, but not so
happily finished as the author meant them to be&mdash;witness, Bob Handy, who
begins a self-conceited coxcomb, and ends a tragedy confidant.</p>

<p>But the good intentions of an author are acceptable: execution will not
always follow conception; and the last may often give as much
instruction, though not equal delight with the former: as an instance,
who does not see the folly of attempting to <i>do every thing</i> in Handy,
though he is more the shadow, than the substance of a character.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding there are some parts, not so good as others, in this
comedy, there is no one character superior to the rest, nor any one in
particular, which makes a forcible impression on the memory:&mdash;this
proves, (in consequence of the acknowledged merit of the play) the fable
to be a good one, and that a pleasing combination has been studied and
effected by the author, with infinite skill, however incompetent to his
own brilliant imagination.</p>

<p>The plot, and serious characters of this comedy, are said to be taken
from a play of Kotzebue's, called, "The Duke of Burgundy,"&mdash;if they are,
Mr. Morton's ingenuity of adapting them to our stage has been equal to
the merit he would have had in conceiving them; for that very play
called, "The Duke of Burgundy," by some verbal translator,&mdash;was
condemned or withdrawn at Covent Garden Theatre, not very long before
"Speed the Plough" was received with the highest marks of admiration.</p>

<p>The characters of Sir Philip Blandford, his brother, and his nephew, may
have been imported from Germany, but surely, all the other personages of
the drama are of pure English growth.</p>

<p>The reception of this play, when first performed, and the high station
it still holds in the public opinion, should make criticism cautious of
attack&mdash;but as works of genuine art alone are held worthy of
investigation, and as all examinations tend to produce a degree of
censure, as well as of praise, "Speed the Plough" is not exempt from the
general lot of every favourite production.</p>

<p>An auditor will be much better pleased with this play, than a reader;
for though it is well written, and interspersed with many poetical
passages, an attentive peruser will find inconsistencies in the
arrangement of the plot and incidents, which an audience, absorbed in
expectation of final events, and hurried away by the charm of scenic
interest, cannot easily detect.</p>

<p>The most prominent of these blemishes are:&mdash;Miss Blandford falls in love
with a plough-boy at first-sight, which she certainly would not have
done, but that some preternatural agent whispered to her, he was a young
man of birth. But whether this magical information came from the
palpitation of her heart, or the quickness of her eye, she has not
said.&mdash;A reader will, however, gladly impute the cause of her sudden
passion to magic, rather than to the want of female refinement.</p>

<p>The daughter has not less decorum in love, than the father in
murder.&mdash;That a character, grave and stern, as Sir Philip Blandford is
described, should entrust any man, especially such a man as Bob Handy,
with a secret, on which, not only his reputation, but his life depended,
can upon no principle of reason be accounted for; unless the author took
into consideration, what has sometimes been observed,&mdash;that a murderer,
in contrivance to conceal his guilt, foolishly fixes on the very means,
which bring him to conviction.</p>

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>In the fore ground a Farm House.&mdash;A view of a Castle at a distance.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Farmer Ashfield</span> <i>discovered at a table, with his jug and pipe.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dame Ashfield</span>, <i>in a riding dress, and a basket under her arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Well, Dame, welcome whoam. What news does thee bring vrom market?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> What news, husband? What I always told you; that Farmer Grundy's
wheat brought five shillings a quarter more than ours did.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> All the better vor he.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Ah! the sun seems to shine on purpose for him.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Come, come, missus, as thee hast not the grace to thank God for
prosperous times, dan't thee grumble when they be unkindly a bit.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> And I assure you, Dame Grundy's butter was quite the crack of
the market.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Be quiet, woolye? aleways ding, dinging Dame Grundy into my
ears&mdash;what will Mrs. Grundy zay? What will Mrs. Grundy think&mdash;Canst thee
be quiet, let ur alone, and behave thyzel pratty?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i>&mdash;Certainly I can&mdash;I'll tell thee, Tummas, what she said at
church last Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Canst thee tell what parson zaid? Noa&mdash;Then I'll tell thee&mdash;A'
zaid that envy were as foul a weed as grows, and cankers all wholesome
plants that be near it&mdash;that's what a' zaid.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> And do you think I envy Mrs. Grundy indeed?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Why dant thee letten her aloane then&mdash;I do verily think when thee
goest to t'other world, the vurst question thee ax 'il be, if Mrs.
Grundy's there&mdash;Zoa be quiet, and behave pratty, do'ye&mdash;Has thee brought
whoam the Salisbury news?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> No, Tummas: but I have brought a rare wadget of news with me.
First and foremost I saw such a mort of coaches, servants, and waggons,
all belonging to Sir Abel Handy, and all coming to the castle&mdash;and a
handsome young man, dressed all in lace, pulled off his hat to me, and
said&mdash;"Mrs. Ashfield, do me the honour of presenting that letter to your
husband."&mdash;So there he stood without his hat&mdash;Oh, Tummas, had you seen
how Mrs. Grundy looked!</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Dom Mrs. Grundy&mdash;be quiet, and let I read, woolye? [<i>Reads.</i>] "My
dear farmer" [<i>Taking off his hat.</i>] Thankye zur&mdash;zame to you, wi' all
my heart and soul&mdash;"My dear farmer"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Farmer&mdash;Why, you are blind, Tummas, it is&mdash;"My dear father"&mdash;Tis
from our own dear Susan.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Odds dickens and daizeys! zoo it be, zure enow!&mdash;"My dear
feyther, you will be surprized"&mdash;Zoo I be, he, he! What pretty writing,
bean't it? all as straight as thof it were ploughed&mdash;"Surprized to hear,
that in a few hours I shall embrace you&mdash;Nelly, who was formerly our
servant, has fortunately married Sir Abel Handy Bart."&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Handy Bart.&mdash;Pugh! Bart. stands for Baronight, mun.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Likely, likely,&mdash;Drabbit it, only to think of the zwaps and
changes of this world!</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Our Nelly married to a great Baronet! I wonder, Tummas, what
Mrs. Grundy will say?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Now, woolye be quiet, and let I read&mdash;"And she has proposed
bringing me to see you; an offer, I hope, as acceptable to my dear
feyther"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> "And mother"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Bless her, how prettily she do write feyther, dan't she?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> And mother.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Ees, but feyther first, though&mdash;&mdash;"As acceptable to my dear
feyther and mother, as to their affectionate daughter&mdash;Susan
Ashfield."&mdash;Now bean't that a pratty letter?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> And, Tummas, is not she a pretty girl?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Ees; and as good as she be pratty&mdash;Drabbit it, I do feel zoo
happy, and zoo warm,&mdash;for all the world like the zun in harvest.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Oh, Tummas, I shall be so pleased to see her, I shan't know
whether I stand on my head or my heels.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Stand on thy head! vor sheame o' thyzel&mdash;behave pratty, do.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Nay, I meant no harm&mdash;Eh, here comes friend Evergreen the
gardener, from the castle. Bless me, what a hurry the old man is in.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Evergreen</span>.</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> Good day, honest Thomas.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Zame to you, measter Evergreen.</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> Have you heard the news?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Any thing about Mrs. Grundy?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Dame, be quiet, woolye now?</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> No, no&mdash;The news is, that my master, Sir Philip Blandford,
after having been abroad for twenty years, returns this day to the
castle; and that the reason of his coming is, to marry his only daughter
to the son of Sir Abel Handy, I think they call him.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> As sure as two-pence, that is Nelly's husband.</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> Indeed!&mdash;Well, Sir Abel and his son will be here immediately;
and, Farmer, you must attend them.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Likely, likely.</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> And, mistress, come and lend us a hand at the castle, will
you?&mdash;Ah, it is twenty long years since I have seen Sir Philip&mdash;Poor
gentleman! bad, bad health&mdash;worn almost to the grave, I am told.&mdash;-What
a lad do I remember him&mdash;till that dreadful&mdash;[<i>Checking himself.</i>] But
where is Henry? I must see him&mdash;must caution him&mdash;[<i>A gun is discharged
at a distance.</i>] That's his gun, I suppose&mdash;he is not far then&mdash;Poor
Henry!</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Poor Henry! I like that indeed! What though he be nobody knows
who, there is not a girl in the parish that is not ready to pull caps
for him&mdash;The Miss Grundys, genteel as they think themselves, would be
glad to snap at him&mdash;If he were our own, we could not love him better.</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> And he deserves to be loved&mdash;Why, he's as handsome as a peach
tree in blossom; and his mind is as free from weeds as my favourite
carnation bed. But, Thomas, run to the castle, and receive Sir Abel and
his son.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> I wool, I wool&mdash;Zo, good day. [<i>Bowing.</i>] Let every man make his
bow, and behave pratty&mdash;that's what I say.&mdash;Missus, do'ye show un Sue's
letter, woolye? Do ye letten see how pratty she do write feyther.</p>

<p class="justright">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Now Tummas is gone, I'll tell you such a story about Mrs.
Grundy&mdash;But come, step in, you must needs be weary; and I am sure a mug
of harvest beer, sweetened with a hearty welcome, will refresh you.</p>

father's hand&mdash;it was a mother's precious tear that dropped upon his
wound&mdash;Oh, how I envied him!</p>

acknowledged by thy race, why, then become the noble founder of a new
one.&mdash;Come with me to the castle, for the last time.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> A singular situation this my old dad has placed me in;
brought me here to marry a woman of fashion and beauty, while I have
been professing, and I've a notion feeling, the most ardent love for the
pretty Susan Ashfield&mdash;Propriety says, take Miss Blandford&mdash;Love says,
take Susan&mdash;Fashion says, take both&mdash;but would Susan consent to such an
arrangement?&mdash;and if she refused, would I consent to part with her?&mdash;Oh,
time enough to put that question, when the previous one is disposed
of&mdash;[<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Dame</span>.] How do you do? How do you do?&mdash;Making lace, I
perceive&mdash;Is it a common employment, here?</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Oh, no, sir? nobody can make it in these parts but myself!&mdash;Mrs.
Grundy, indeed, pretends&mdash;but, poor woman! she knows no more of it than
you do.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Than I do! that's vastly well;&mdash;My dear madam, I passed
two months at Mechlin for the express purpose.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> You don't do it right&mdash;now I can do it much better than
that. Give me leave, and I'll shew you the true Mechlin method [<i>Turns

of your native land has given additional lustre to your
charms!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] If my wife looked so&mdash;Ah! but where can Bob be?&mdash;You

<p class="justright">[<i>Sees&nbsp;him.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> [<i>Abashed.</i>] Yes, that's Bob!</p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Curse me if I can tell. [<i>Hits him with his stick.</i>] Get up,

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> [<i>Starting up.</i>] Zounds! how unlucky! Ma'am, your most

<p class="justright">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Is not she, Bob?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss B</span>.] In your journey from the coast, I conclude
you took London in your way? Hush! </p>

<p class="justright">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dame</span>.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh no, sir, I could not so soon venture into the <i>beau monde</i>;
a stranger just arrived from Germany&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> The very reason&mdash;the most fashionable introduction
possible! but I perceive, sir, you have here imitated other German
importations, and only restored to us our native excellence.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I assure you, sir, I am eager to seize my birthright, the pure
and envied immunities of an English woman!</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Then I trust, madam, you will be patriot enough to agree
with me, that as a nation is poor, whose only wealth is
importation&mdash;that therefore the humble native artist may ever hope to
obtain from his countrymen those fostering smiles, without which genius
must sicken and industry decay. But it requires no <i>valet de place</i> to
conduct you through the purlieus of fashion, for now the way of the
world is, for every one to pursue their own way; and following the
fashion is differing as much as possible from the rest of your
acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> But, surely sir, there is some distinguishing feature, by
which the votaries of fashion are known?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Yes; but that varies extremely&mdash;sometimes fashionable
celebrity depends on a high waist&mdash;sometimes on a low
carriage&mdash;sometimes on high play, and sometimes on low breeding&mdash;last
winter it rested solely on green peas!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Green peas!</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Green peas&mdash;That lady was the most enchanting, who could
bring the greatest quantity of green peas to her table at Christmas! the
struggle was tremendous! Mrs. Rowley Powley had the best of it by five
pecks and a half, but it having been unfortunately proved, that at her
ball there was room to dance and eat conveniently&mdash;that no lady received
a black eye, and no coachman was killed, the thing was voted decent and
comfortable, and scouted accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Is comfort then incompatible with fashion?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Certainly!&mdash;Comfort in high life would be as preposterous
as a lawyer's bag crammed with truth, or his wig decorated with
coquelicot ribbons! No&mdash;it is not comfort and selection that is sought,
but numbers and confusion! So that a fashionable party resembles
Smithfield market,&mdash;only a good one when plentifully stocked&mdash;and ladies
are reckoned by the score, like sheep, and their husbands by droves,
like horned cattle!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Ha, ha! and the conversation&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Oh! like the assembly&mdash;confused, vapid, and abundant; as
"How do, ma'am!&mdash;no accident at the door?&mdash;he, he!"&mdash;"Only my carriage
broke to pieces!"&mdash;"I hope you had not your pocket picked!"&mdash;"Won't you
sit down to faro?"&mdash;"Have you many to-night?"&mdash;"A few, about six
hundred!"&mdash;"Were you at Lady Overall's?"&mdash;"Oh yes; a delicious crowd,
and plenty of peas, he, he!"&mdash;and thus runs the fashionable race.</p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Yes; and a precious run it is&mdash;full gallop all the way:
first they run on&mdash;then their fortune is run through&mdash;then bills are run
up&mdash;then they are run hard&mdash;then they've a run of luck&mdash;then they run
out, and then they run away!&mdash;But I'll forgive fashion all its follies
in consideration of one of its blessed laws.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> What may that be!</p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> That husband and wife must never be seen together.</p>

man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> At the beginning of the contest I observed a gentleman; his
horses, I believe, were unruly; but my attention was too much occupied
to allow me to notice more. </p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Why, Bob, where have you been?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I don't know where I've been.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> What! All I could keep of your nonsensical ricketty
plough. </p>

<p class="justright">[<i>Walks about</i>, <span class="smcap">Sir Abel</span> <i>following.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Come, none of that, sir.&mdash;Don't abuse my plough, to cover
your ignorance, sir? where is it, sir? and where are my famous
Leicestershire horses, sir?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Where? ha, ha, ha! I'll tell you as nearly as I can, ha,
ha! What's the name of the next county?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> It be called Wiltshire, zur.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Then, dad, upon the nicest calculation I am able to make,
they are at this moment engaged in the very patriotic act of ploughing
Salisbury plain, ha ha! I saw them fairly over that hill, full gallop,
with the curricle plough at their heels.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Ha, ha! a good one, ha ha!</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> But never mind, father, you must again set your invention
to work, and I my toilet:&mdash;rather a deranged figure to appear before a
lady in. [<i>Fiddles.</i>] Hey day! What! are you going to dance?</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Ees, zur; I suppose you can sheake a leg a bit?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I fancy I can dance every possible step, from the <i>pas
ruse</i> to the war-dance of the Catawbaws.</p>

they'll be deadly hurt an' you won't gig it a bit wi' un.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir Abel.</i> Bob's an excellent dancer.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I dare say he is, sir? but on this occasion, I think I ought
to dance with the young man, who gained the prize&mdash;I think it would be
most pleasant&mdash;most proper, I mean; and I am glad you agree with
me.&mdash;So, sir, if you'll accept my hand&mdash; </p>

<p class="justright">[<span class="smcap">Henry</span> <i>takes it.</i></p>

dance?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I dance!&mdash;no, I'll look at them&mdash;I'll quietly look on.</p>

<p>Does this desolation affect the old man?&mdash;Come near me&mdash;Time has laid a

<p><i>Everg.</i> Oh, my dear master! can twenty years have wrought the change I

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> No; [<i>Striking his breast.</i>] 'tis the canker here that

<p><i>Everg.</i> My dear master! I confess my want of duty. Alas! I had not

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Everg.</i> Nay, forgive me! wiser than I have felt such terrors.&mdash;The

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Then the task remains with me. Dreadful thought! I can

<p><i>Everg.</i> Hush! your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Dear father! I came the moment I heard you wished to see me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> My good child, thou art the sole support that props my
feeble life. I fear my wish for thy company deprives thee of much
pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh no! what pleasure can be equal to that of giving you
happiness? Am I not rewarded in seeing your eyes beam with pleasure on
me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> 'Tis the pale reflection of the lustre I see sparkling
there.&mdash;But, tell me, did your lover gain the prize?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, papa.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Few men of his rank&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh! you mean Mr. Handy?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> No; he did not.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Then, whom did <i>you</i> mean?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Did you say lover? I&mdash;I mistook.&mdash;No&mdash;a young man called Henry
obtained the prize.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> And how did Mr. Handy succeed?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh! It was so ridiculous!&mdash;I will tell you, papa, what
happened to him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> To Mr. Handy?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes; as soon as the contest was over Henry presented himself.
I was surprised at seeing a young man so handsome and elegant as Henry
is.&mdash;Then I placed the medal round Henry's neck, and was told, that poor
Henry&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Henry!&mdash;So, my love, this is your account of Mr. Robert
Handy!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, papa&mdash;no, papa&mdash;he came afterwards, dressed so
ridiculously, that even Henry could not help smiling.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Henry again!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Then we had a dance.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Of course you danced with your lover?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, papa.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> How does Mr. Handy dance?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh! he did not dance till&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> You danced with your lover?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes&mdash;no papa!&mdash;Somebody said (I don't know who) that I ought
to dance with Henry, because&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Still Henry! Oh! some rustic boy. My dear child, you talk
as if you loved this Henry.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh! no, papa&mdash;and I am certain he don't love me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, papa; for, when he touched my hand, he trembled as if I
terrified him; and instead of looking at me as you do, who I am sure
love me, when our eyes met, he withdrew his and cast them on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> And these are the reasons, which make you conclude he does
not love you?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, papa.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> And probably you could adduce proof equally convincing
that you don't love him?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh, yes&mdash;quite; for in the dance he sometimes paid attention
to other young women, and I was so angry with him! Now, you know, papa,
I love you&mdash;and I am sure I should not have been angry with you had you
done so.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> But one question more&mdash;Do you think Mr. Handy loves you?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I have never thought about it, papa.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> I am satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Yes, I knew I should convince you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Oh, love; malign and subtle tyrant, how falsely art thou
painted blind! 'tis thy votaries are so; for what but blindness can
prevent their seeing thy poisoned shaft, which is for ever doomed to
rankle in the victim's heart.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Oh! now I am certain I am not in love; for I feel no rankling
at my heart. I feel the softest, sweetest sensation I ever experienced.
But, papa, you must come to the lawn. I don't know why, but to-day
nature seems enchanting; the birds sing more sweetly, and the flowers
give more perfume.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Such was the day my youthful fancy
pictured!&mdash;How did it close!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I promised Henry your protection.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Indeed! that was much. Well I will see your rustic here.
This infant passion must be crushed. Poor wench! some artless boy has
caught thy youthful fancy.&mdash;Thy arm, my child. </p>

see no orphans clothed with my beneficence, no anguish assuaged by my

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Then I am sure my dear father wishes to show his kind
intentions. So I will begin by placing one under his protection [<i>Goes

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> His presence brings back recollections, which drive me to
madness!&mdash;How came he here?&mdash;Who have I to curse for this?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> [<i>Falling on his neck.</i>] Your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Oh sir! tell me&mdash;on my knees I ask it! do my parents live!
Bless me with my father's name, and my days shall pass in active
gratitude&mdash;my nights in prayers for you. [<span class="smcap">Sir Philip</span> <i>views him with
severe contempt.</i>] Do not mock my misery! Have you a heart?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Yes; of marble. Cold and obdurate to the world&mdash;ponderous
and painful to myself&mdash;Quit my sight for ever!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Go, Henry, and save me from my father's curse.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I obey: cruel as the command is, I obey it&mdash;I shall often look
at this, [<i>Touching the medal.</i>] and think on the blissful moment, when
your hand placed it there.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Ah! tear it from his breast. </p>

<p class="justright">[<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>advances.</i></p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Sooner take my life! It is the first honour I have earned, and
it is no mean one; for it assigns me the first rank among the sons of
industry! This is my claim to the sweet rewards of honest labour! This
will give me competence, nay more, enable me to despise your tyranny!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Rash boy, mark! Avoid me, and be secure.&mdash;Repeat this
intrusion, and my vengeance shall pursue thee.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I defy its power!&mdash;You are in England, sir, where the man, who
bears about him an upright heart, bears a charm too potent for tyranny
to humble. Can your frown wither up my youthful vigour? No!&mdash;Can your
malediction disturb the slumbers of a quiet conscience? No! Can your
breath stifle in my heart the adoration it feels for that pitying angel?
Oh, no!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Wretch! you shall be taught the difference between us!</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I feel it now! proudly feel it!&mdash;You hate the man, that never
wronged you&mdash;I could love the man, that injures me&mdash;You meanly triumph
o'er a worm&mdash;I make a giant tremble.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Take him from my sight! Why am I not obeyed?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Henry, if you wish my hate should not accompany my father's,
instantly begone.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> O Heaven!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Have you not promised me the disposal of your hand?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Alas! my father! I didn't then know the difficulty of
obedience!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Hear, then, the reasons why I demand compliance. You think
I hold these rich estates&mdash;Alas, the shadow only, not the substance.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> Explain, my father!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> When I left my native country, I left it with a heart
lacerated by every wound, that the falsehood of others, or my own
conscience, could inflict. Hateful to myself, I became the victim of
dissipation&mdash;I rushed to the gaming table, and soon became the dupe of
villains.&mdash;My ample fortune was lost; I detected one in the act of
fraud, and having brought him to my feet, he confessed a plan had been
laid for my ruin; that he was but an humble instrument; for that the
man, who, by his superior genius, stood possessed of all the mortgages
and securities I had given, was one Morrington.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I have heard you name him before. Did you not know this
Morrington?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> No; he, like his deeds, avoided the light&mdash;Ever dark,
subtle, and mysterious. Collecting the scattered remnant of my fortune,
I wandered, wretched and desolate, till, in a peaceful village, I first
beheld thy mother, humble in birth, but exalted in virtue. The morning
after our marriage she received a packet, containing these words: "The
reward of virtuous love, presented by a repentant villain;" and which
also contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> And no name?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> None; nor could I ever guess at the generous donor. I need
not tell thee what my heart suffered, when death deprived me of her.
Thus circumstanced, this good man, Sir Abel Handy, proposed to unite our
families by marriage; and in consideration of what he termed the honour
of our alliance, agreed to pay off every incumbrance on my estates, and
settle them as a portion on you and his son. Yet still another wonder
remains.&mdash;When I arrive, I find no claim whatever has been made, either
by Morrington or his agents. What am I to think? Can Morrington have
perished, and with him his large claims to my property? Or, does he
withhold the blow, to make it fall more heavily?</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> 'Tis very strange! very mysterious! But my father has not told
me what misfortune led him to leave his native country.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>Greatly agitated.</i>] Ha!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> May I not know it?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Oh, never, never, never!</p>

<p><i>Miss B.</i> I will not ask it&mdash;Be composed&mdash;Let me wipe away those drops
of anguish from your brow.&mdash;How cold your cheek is! My father, the
evening damps will harm you&mdash;Come in&mdash;I will be all you wish&mdash;indeed I

this heart will prove its gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Dame.</i> That day, Henry, is every day.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i> Dang it! never be down hearted. I do know as well as can be, zome
good luck will turn up. All the way I comed whoam I looked to vind a

sacrifice the lovely Emma, by a marriage her heart revolts at. Tell him,
the life and fortune of a parent are not his own; he holds them but in
trust for his offspring. Bid him reflect, that, while his daughter
merits the brightest rewards a father can bestow, she is by that father
doomed to the harshest fate tyranny can inflict."</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> He told me you had been duped of your fortune by sharpers.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Aye, he knows that well. Young man, mark me:&mdash;This
Morrington, whose precepts wear the face of virtue, and whose practice
seems benevolence, was the chief of the hellish banditti that ruined me.</p>

life against life, but by that most cowardly villain, who, in the moment
when reason sleeps, and passion is roused, draws his snares around you,

friend.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah! how shall I act?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Is my demand unreasonable?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Strictly just&mdash;But oh!&mdash;you know not what you ask&mdash;Do you
not pity me?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Why then seek to change it into hate?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Confidence seldom generates hate&mdash;Mistrust always.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Most true.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I am not impelled by curiosity to ask your friendship. I
scorn so mean a motive. Believe me, sir, the folly and levity of my
character proceed merely from the effervescence of my heart&mdash;you will
find its substance warm, steady, and sincere.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> I believe it from my soul.&mdash;Yes, you shall hear my story;
I will lay before your view the agony, with which this wretched bosom is
loaded.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I am proud of your confidence, and am prepared to receive
it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Not here&mdash;let me lead you to the eastern part of the
castle, my young friend&mdash;mark me: This is no common trust I repose in
you; for I place my life in your hands.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> And the pledge I give for its security is, what alone
gives value to life, my honour. </p>

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A gloomy Gallery in the Castle&mdash;in the centre a strongly barred
door.&mdash;The gallery hung with portraits.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Henry</span> <i>discovered examining a particular portrait, which occupies a
conspicuous situation in the gallery.</i></p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Whenever curiosity has led me to this gallery, that portrait
has attracted my attention&mdash;the features are peculiarly interesting. One
of the house of Blandford&mdash;Blandford&mdash;-my name&mdash;perhaps my father. To
remain longer ignorant of my birth, I feel impossible. There is a point
when patience ceases to be a virtue&mdash;Hush! I hear footsteps&mdash;Ah! Sir
Philip and another in close conversation. Shall I avoid them?&mdash;No&mdash;Shall
I conceal myself, and observe them?&mdash;Curse on the base suggestion!&mdash;No&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Philip</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Handy</span>, <i>jun.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> That chamber contains the mystery.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>Turning round.</i>] Observe that portrait. [<i>Seeing</i>
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>&mdash;<i>starts.</i>] Who's there?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.] Sir, we wish to be private.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> My being here, sir, was merely the effect of accident. I scorn
intrusion. [<i>Bows.</i>] But the important words are spoken&mdash;that chamber
contains the mystery. </p>

<p class="justright">[<i>Aside.&mdash;Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Who is that youth?</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> You there behold his father&mdash;my brother&mdash;[<i>Weeps.</i>]&mdash;I've
not beheld that face these twenty years.&mdash;Let me again peruse its
lineaments. [<i>In an agony of grief.</i>] Oh, God! how I loved that man!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Be composed.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> I will endeavour. Now listen to my story.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> You rivet my attention.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> While we were boys, my father died intestate. So I, as
elder born, became the sole possessor of his fortune; but the moment the
law gave me power, I divided, in equal portions, his large possessions,
one of which I with joy presented to my brother.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> It was noble.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>With suppressed agony.</i>] You shall now hear, sir, how I
was rewarded. Chance placed in my view a young woman of superior
personal charms; my heart was captivated&mdash;Fortune she possessed not&mdash;but
mine was ample. She blessed me by consenting to our union, and my
brother approved my choice.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> How enviable your situation!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Oh! [<i>Sighing deeply.</i>] On the evening previous to my
intended marriage, with a mind serene as the departing sun, whose
morning beam was to light me to happiness, I sauntered to a favourite
tree, where, lover-like, I had marked the name of my destined bride,
and, with every nerve braced to the tone of ecstasy, I was wounding the
bark with a deeper impression of the name&mdash;when, oh, God!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Pray proceed.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> When the loved offspring of my mother, and the woman my
soul adored&mdash;the only two beings on earth, who had wound themselves
round my heart by every tie dear to the soul of man, placed themselves
before me; I heard him&mdash;even now the sound is in my ears, and drives me
to madness&mdash;I heard him breathe vows of love, which she answered with
burning kisses&mdash;He pitied his poor brother, and told her he had prepared
a vessel to bear her for ever from me.&mdash;They were about to depart, when
the burning fever in my heart rushed upon my brain&mdash;Picture the young
tiger, when first his savage nature rouses him to vengeance&mdash;the knife
was in my gripe&mdash;I sprang upon them&mdash;with one hand I tore the faithless
woman from his damned embrace, and with the other&mdash;stabbed my brother to
the heart.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> The wretched woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Was secretly conveyed here&mdash;even to that chamber.&mdash;She
proved pregnant, and in giving birth to a son, paid the forfeit of her
perjury by death. My task being ended, yours begins.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Mine!</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> Yes, that chamber contains evidence of my shame; the fatal
instrument, with other guilty proofs, lie there concealed&mdash;can you
wonder I dread to visit the scene of horror&mdash;can you wonder I implore
you, in mercy, to save me from the task? Oh! my friend, enter the
chamber, bury in endless night those instruments of blood, and I will
kneel and worship you.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Sir Philip.</i> [<i>Weeps.</i>] Will you? [<i>Embraces him.</i>] I am unused to
kindness from man, and it affects me. Oh! can you press to your
guiltless heart that bloodstained hand!</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Sir Philip, let men without faults condemn&mdash;I must pity
you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A wooded view of the country.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Susan Ashfield</span>, <i>who looks about with anxiety, and then comes
forward.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> I fear my conduct is very imprudent.&mdash;Has not Mr. Handy told me
he is engaged to another? But 'tis hard for the heart to forego, without
one struggle, its only hope of happiness; and, conscious of my honour,
what have I to fear? Perhaps he may repent of his unkindness to me&mdash;at
least I'll put his passion to the proof; if he be worthy of my love,
happiness is for ever mine; if not, I'll tear him from my breast, though
from the wound my life's blood should follow. Ah! he comes&mdash;I feel I am
a coward, and my poor alarmed heart trembles at its approaching
trial&mdash;pardon me, female delicacy, if for a moment I seem to pass thy
sacred limits. </p>

<p class="justright">[<i>Retires up the stage.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Handy</span>, <i>jun.</i></p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> By Heavens! the misfortunes of Sir Philip Blandford weigh
so heavily on my spirits, that&mdash;but confusion to melancholy! I am come
here to meet an angel, who will, in a moment, drive away the blue devils
like mist before the sun. Let me again read the dear words; [<i>Reading a
letter.</i>] "I confess, I love you still;" [<i>Kisses the letter.</i>] but I
dare not believe their truth till her sweet lips confirm it. Ah! she's
there&mdash;Susan, my angel! a thousand thanks. A life of love can alone
repay the joy your letter gave me.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Do you not despise me?</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> No; love you more than ever.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Oh! Robert, this is the very crisis of my fate.&mdash;&mdash;From this
moment we meet with honour, or we meet no more. If we must part,
perhaps, when you lead your happy bride to church, you may stumble over
your Susan's grave. Well, be it so.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Away with such sombre thoughts!</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Tell me my doom&mdash;yet hold&mdash;you are wild, impetuous&mdash;you do not
give your heart fair play&mdash;therefore promise me (perhaps 'tis the last
favour I shall ask), that before you determine whether our love shall
die or live with honour, you will remain here alone a few moments, and
that you will give those moments to reflection.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> I do&mdash;I will.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> With a throbbing heart I will wait at a little distance. May
virtuous love and sacred honour direct his thoughts! </p>

<p class="justright">[<i>Aside.&mdash;Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Yes, I will reflect, that I am the most fortunate fellow
in England. She loves me still&mdash;what is the consequence?&mdash;that love will
triumph&mdash;that she will be mine&mdash;mine without the degradation of
marriage&mdash;love, pride, all gratified&mdash;how I shall be envied when I
triumphantly pass the circles of fashion! One will cry, "Who is that
angel?"&mdash;another, "Happy fellow!" then Susan will smile around&mdash;will she
smile? oh yes&mdash;she will be all gaiety&mdash;mingle with the votaries of
pleasure, and&mdash;what! Susan Ashfield the companion of licentious
women!&mdash;Damnation!&mdash;no! I wrong her&mdash;she would not&mdash;she would rather
shun society&mdash;she would be melancholy&mdash;melancholy! [<i>Sighs, and looks at
his watch.</i>]&mdash;would the time were over!&mdash;Pshaw! I think of it too
seriously&mdash;'Tis false&mdash;I do not.&mdash;Should her virtue yield to love, would
not remorse affect her health? should I not behold that lovely form
sicken and decay&mdash;perhaps die?&mdash;die! then what am I?&mdash;a villain, loaded
with her parents' curses and my own.&mdash;Let me fly from the dreadful
thought.&mdash;But how fly from it?&mdash;[<i>Calmly.</i>]&mdash;By placing before my
imagination a picture of more honourable lineaments.&mdash;I make her my
wife.&mdash;Ah! then she would smile on me&mdash;there's rapture in the
thought;&mdash;instead of vice producing decay, I behold virtue emblazoning
beauty; instead of Susan on the bed of death, I behold her giving to my
hopes a dear pledge of our mutual love. She places it in my arms&mdash;down
her father's honest face runs a tear&mdash;but 'tis the tear of joy. Oh, this
will be luxury! paradise!&mdash;Come, Susan!&mdash;come, my love, my soul&mdash;my

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> Yes, those charms have conquered.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Oh! no; do not so disgrace the victory you have gained&mdash;'tis
your own virtue that has triumphed.</p>

<p><i>Handy, jun.</i> My Susan! how true it is that fools alone are vicious. But
let us fly to my father, and obtain his consent. On recollection, that
may not be quite so easy. His arrangements with Sir Philip Blandford
are&mdash;are&mdash;not mine, so there's an end of that. And Sir Philip, by
misfortune, knows how to appreciate happiness. Then poor Miss
Blandford&mdash;upon my soul I feel for her.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> [<i>Ironically.</i>] Come, don't make yourself miserable. If my
suspicions be true, she'll not break her heart for your loss.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
